Requirements - 

In our TicTacToe game, 2 players playing on the same computer choose if they want to be 'X' or 'O'. The players will take turns placing their markings ('X', 'O') by 

typing out any number from 1-9 and entering it into the program. Each number corresponds to one of the spots on the 3x3 grid. The players are aiming towards getting 

3 markings in a row diagonally, horizontally, or vertically before the other player. Players can mark anywhere they or the opponent haven't already marked. 


Design - 

class TicToc: - where all the functions are defined for the tictactoe game

import random - used in whoGoesFirst() 

def drawboard() - Draws the 3x3 grid for the game and sets each square on a grid to a counting number

def chooseLetter() - Asks the player one if they want to be 'X' or 'O' and takes the input and sets the player two as the other letter.

def whoGoesFirst() - Chooses a random player to go first

def playAgain() - Asks the players if they want to play again and takes their input and loops the code back to the 'while True:' statement.

def isWinner() - Draws out all of the win conditions for the game and returns true if one of the players win 

def isSpaceFree() - returns true if the move that the player entered hasn't been used yet

def getPlayerMove() - takes the input of either player one or player two and uses isSpaceFree to check if they can move there

def isBoardFull - returns true if every space on the board is taken

game = TicToc() - creates object named game that accesses the attributes of the TicToc class
